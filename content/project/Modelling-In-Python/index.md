A Jupyter notebook (written in Python) that provides an introduction into validating computational models and fitting models to human data.

This notebook demonstrates:

* How to validate models using parameter recovery
* How to validate models using model recovery
* How to fit human data to a series of models
* How to simulate human performance using computational models
* How to adjudicate between different models

Made for a tutorial given in the Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, 2024
