These R scripts provide a high level summary of using R to analyze data.

Nothing too extensive, mostly a series of scripts (well, lectures) to do the following:

* Load data into R
* Load packages
* Do simple visualization
* Run simple statistics and tests
* Provides fake data to analyze

There is also some sample powerpoint slides which work through running an ANOVA and some direct group comparisons.

Made for PSYC 300A and 300B at the University of Victoria. Completed while I was both teaching tutorials and the course itself.
