A set of functions designed to solve two different types of Bandit tasks.

These scripts provide:

* Three different algorithms are provided: eGreedy, Softmax, Chance
* Two different environments: stochastic/non-stationary, deterministic/stationary
* Plots algorithm performance in terms of reward obtained, optimal arm selected, and prediction error

Made at the University of Victoria, 2021
