Contains some code and associated functions to solve Grid world. The solutions only use two relatively simple algorithms
  (eGreedy, Softmax) and was generated mostly as a proof of concept that these algorithms could work and be applied
  to a human data. The environment is very simple (20 x 20 grid) with no walls or punishments.
  Generates some performance measures such as the overall moves, an expected value heat-map, the first walk, and the last walk.
