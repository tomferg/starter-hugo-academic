Matlab scripts to validate and test computational models of human choice data

A series of Matlab scripts, functions, and some summary slides which highlight how to:

* Validate a series of Reinforcement Learning models
* Tune model parameters
* Conduct both automatic (using FMINCON) and manual log likelihood estimation
* Simulate human performance
* Find the best fitting model for human choice data

Powerpoint slides provide the theoretical background (some ideas adapted from Lewandowsky & Farell - Computational Modelling of Cognition) of computational modelling

Made for a workshop hosted at the University of Victoria in 2023.
