Matlab code for great introductory book of computational modelling in humans by Ferrell and Lewandowsky

* Code is for the book exercises - up to chapter 7
* I mostly just translated the R code provided with the book to Matlab as an exercise to make sure I understood the model
* Use at your own discretion of course but it worked well on my home machine
* Link to the Book: https://psy-farrell.github.io/computational-modelling//about/
