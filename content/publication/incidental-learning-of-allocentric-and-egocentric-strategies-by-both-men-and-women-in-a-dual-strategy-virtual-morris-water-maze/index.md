abstract: In studies of human navigation, an underlying assumption is that, by
  nature, navigators are proficient with and strongly biased toward using only
  one strategy, either allocentric (cognitive mapping) or egocentric
  (stimulus-response based). Further, research often suggests that males are
  allocentric navigators whereas females are egocentric navigators. We tested
  these binary assumptions using two versions of a virtual Morris water maze
  (MWM). The Dual-strategy maze could be solved using either an allocentric or
  an egocentric strategy. Preferred strategy was tested by alternating test and
  probe trials. Two “Forced-strategy” probe trials tested navigators’ ability to
  use their non-preferred strategy. Participants then completed the Place maze
  that was best solved using an allocentric strategy. In the Dual-strategy maze,
  there was no particular order of acquisition of a preferred strategy and a
  quarter of participants switched strategies; this switching was bilateral
  (from egocentric to allocentric and vice-versa). Navigators were most
  competent in the use of their preferred strategy. Importantly, navigators did
  learn (incidentally) information related to their non-preferred strategy and
  were capable of using that strategy. This pattern of results was shown for
  both males and females, although females did show a stronger preference for
  egocentric navigation than did males. We concluded that navigators can use all
  environmental information available to them and that the tendency to view
  people as innately allocentric or egocentric navigators does not allow for
  more nuanced investigations of navigational ability. Such investigations would
  better inform research into deficits in spatial ability in clinical
  populations.
