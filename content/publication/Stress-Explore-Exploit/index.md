abstract: When humans are faced with multiple options, they must decide 
  whether to choose a novel or less certain option (explore) or stick with 
  what they know (exploit). Exploration is a fundamental cognitive process. 
  Importantly, when humans attempt to solve the explore-exploit dilemma, they 
  must effectively incorporate both feedback and uncertainty to guide their actions. 
  While prior work has shown that both acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) 
  stress can disrupt how humans solve the explore-exploit dilemma, the mechanisms 
  of how this occurs are unclear. For example, does stress disrupt how people 
  integrate feedback to guide their decisions to explore or exploit, or does stress 
  disrupt computations of uncertainty regarding their choices? Importantly, the 
  use of electroencephalography as a tool can help reveal the impact of stress 
  on explore-exploit decision making by measuring neural signals sensitive to 
  feedback learning and uncertainty. In the present dissertation, I provide evidence 
  from a series of experiments where I examined the impact of both acute and chronic 
  stress on the explore-exploit dilemma while electroencephalographic data was 
  collected. In experiment 1, I exposed participants to an acute stressor and then 
  examined their decisions to switch or stay – as a proxy for explore and exploit 
  decisions – in a multi-arm bandit paradigm. I found tentative evidence that the 
  acute stress response disrupted both the feedback learning signal (the reward positivity) 
  and the uncertainty signal (the switch P300). In experiment 2 I adopted a 
  computational neuroscience approach and directly classified participants decisions 
  as explorations or exploitations using reinforcement learning models. There was 
  only an effect of the acute stress response on feedback signals, in this case, the 
  feedback P300. In experiments 1 and 2, I used contextual bandit tasks where the 
  reward probabilities of the options shifted throughout, and there was no behavioural 
  effect of acute stress on task performance or exploration rate. However, in 
  experiment 3, I examined a learnable bandit where one option was preferred. 
  Again, using computational modelling and electroencephalography, I found tentative
  evidence that the acute stress response disrupted the feedback learning signals 
  (the feedback P300) and stronger evidence that acute stress disrupted the 
  uncertainty signal (the exploration P300). As well, I observed that the acute 
  stress response reduced task performance and increased exploration rate. Lastly, 
  in experiment 4, I examined the impact of chronic stress exposure on explore-exploit 
  decision making and electrophysiology – while I found no effects of chronic stress, 
  I believe future research is necessary. Taken together, these findings provide novel 
  evidence for the neural mechanisms of how the acute stress response impacts the 
  explore-exploit dilemma through disruptions to feedback learning and assessments of uncertainty. 
  These findings also highlight how theories of the P300 signal may not be properly 
  capturing the varied role of the P300 in cognition.
