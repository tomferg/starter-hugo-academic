abstract: Stress and stress hormones are known to influence the function of the
  hippocampus, a brain structure critical for cognitive-map-based, allocentric
  spatial navigation. The caudate nucleus, a brain structure critical for
  stimulus-response-based, egocentric navigation, is not as sensitive to stress.
  Evidence for this comes from rodent studies, which show that acute stress or
  stress hormones impair allocentric, but not egocentric navigation. However,
  there have been few studies investigating the effect of acute stress on human
  spatial navigation, and the results of these have been equivocal. To date, no
  study has investigated whether acute stress can shift human navigational
  strategy selection between allocentric and egocentric navigation. The present
  study investigated this question by exposing participants to an acute
  psychological stressor (the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task, PASAT),
  before testing navigational strategy selection in the Dual-Strategy Maze, a
  modified virtual Morris water maze. In the Dual-Strategy maze, participants
  can chose to navigate using a constellation of extra-maze cues
  (allocentrically) or using a single cue proximal to the goal platform
  (egocentrically). Surprisingly, PASAT stress biased participants to solve the
  maze allocentrically significantly more, rather than less, often. These
  findings have implications for understanding the effects of acute stress on
  cognitive function in general, and the function of the hippocampus in
  particular.
