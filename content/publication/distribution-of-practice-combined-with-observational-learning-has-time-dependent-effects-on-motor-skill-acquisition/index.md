abstract: Studies of the benefits of a distributed practice schedule on motor
  skill acquisition have typically found that distribution of practice results
  in better learning. However, less research has focused on how the benefits of
  distributed practice are impacted by timing during acquisition. To examine how
  timing of skill acquisition interacts with distribution of practice we had two
  groups of participants complete either an extensive massed or distributed
  training schedule to learn a speed stacking sequence across ten sessions. For
  participants in both groups, we provided observational learning to facilitate
  skill acquisition. Analysis of speed stacking time on a retention test
  revealed an overall benefit for the distributed relative to the massed
  practice group. Interestingly, our analysis of the benefits of distributed
  practice during training only showed performance benefits in the early session
  (session one) and later sessions (sessions eight, nine, and ten) of skill
  acquisition but not mid-way through it (sessions two through seven). Our
  results support previous findings highlighting the learning benefits of a
  distributed practice schedule but suggest that these benefits occur
  differentially throughout acquisition. Our work also replicates research
  demonstrating that observational learning is more beneficial when it is yoked
  to actual practice.
