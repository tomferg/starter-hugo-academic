abstract: Music has been a therapeutic strategy proposed to improve impaired
  movement performance, but there remains a lack of understanding of how music
  impacts motor cortical activity. Thus, the purpose of this study is to use a
  time–frequency analysis (i.e., wavelet) of electroencephalographic (EEG) data
  to determine differences in motor and auditory cortical activity when moving
  to music at two different rates. Twenty healthy young adults tapped their
  index finger while electroencephalography was collected. There were three
  conditions (tapping in time with a tone and with two contrasting music
  styles), and each condition was repeated at two different rates (70 and 140
  beats per minute). A time–frequency Morlet wavelet analysis was completed for
  electrodes of interest over the sensorimotor areas (FC3, FC4, FCz, C3, C4, Cz)
  and the primary auditory areas (T7, T8). Cluster-based permutation testing was
  applied to the electrodes of interest for all conditions. Results showed few
  differences between cortical oscillations when moving to music versus a tone.
  However, the two music conditions elicited a variety of distinct responses,
  particularly at the slower movement rate. These results suggest that music
  style and movement rate should be considered when designing therapeutic
  applications that include music to target motor performance.
