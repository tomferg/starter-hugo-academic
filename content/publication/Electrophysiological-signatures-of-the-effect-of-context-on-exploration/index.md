abstract: Humans are excellent at modifying our behaviour depending on context. 
  For example, humans will change how they explore when losses are possible compared
  to when they are not possible. However, it remains unclear what specific cognitive 
  and neural processes are modulated when exploring in different contexts. Here,
  we had participants learn within two different contexts - in one the 
  participants could lose points while in the other the participants could not. 
  Our goal was to determine how the inclusion of losses impacted human exploratory 
  behaviour (experiment one), and whether we could explain the neural basis of 
  these effects using EEG (experiment two). In experiment one, we found that participants 
  preferred less-variable choices and explored less often when losses were possible. 
  In addition, computational modelling revealed that participants engaged in less 
  random exploration, had a lower rate of learning, and showed less choice 
  perseverance when losses were possible. In experiment two, we replicated these 
  effects while examining a series of neural signals involved in exploration. During 
  exploration, signals tied to working memory and learning (P3b), attention orienting (P3a), 
  and motivation (late positive potential; an exploratory analysis) were also enhanced 
  when losses were possible. These neural differences contribute to why exploratory 
  behaviour is changed by different learning contexts and can be explained by the 
  theoretical claim that losses recruit attention and lead to increased task focus. 
  These results provide insight into the cognitive processes that underlie exploration, 
  and how exploratory behaviour changes across contexts.
