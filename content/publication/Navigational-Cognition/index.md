abstract: In the study of navigation, frequently it is assumed that navigation 
  is accomplished using either an allocentric strategy based on a cognitive map, 
  or an egocentric strategy based on stimulus response associations. Further, it is 
  frequently assumed that individual navigators, or even entire genders, are only 
  capable of navigating by one strategy or the other. The present study investigated 
  whether individuals or genders were limited to a particular navigational strategy 
  and whether both strategies might be learned or used at the same time. In the 
  present study, undergraduate students were tested in a virtual Morris water maze 
  that was modified to allow successful and efficient navigation using either an 
  allocentric or an egocentric strategy. Learning trials on which the participants 
  had to learn the location of the platform were alternated with probe trials on which
  participants would show which strategy they were using. At the end of testing, 
  participants were given a series of tests to determine what knowledge they had 
  acquired and which strategies they were capable of using. Results indicated that - 
  a) most people preferred to navigate egocentrically in this maze, but some preferred
  to navigate allocentrically, b) people tended to use an egocentrically strategy 
  first, but it was not a necessary step to learning to navigate allocentrically, 
  c) people were better at their preferred strategy, d) people learned information 
  about their non-preferred strategy, and e) those who preferred to navigate 
  egocentrically could nevertheless learn to navigate allocentrically. Surprisingly, 
  all of these results were true for both men and women, although women tended 
  to prefer egocentric navigation at a higher rate than men, and men outperformed 
  women when forced to navigate allocentrically. These results suggest it may be 
  too simple to think of navigators as being capable of only a single navigational 
  strategy or of learning only one strategy at a time.
