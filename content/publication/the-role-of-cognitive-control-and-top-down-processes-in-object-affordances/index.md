abstract: "A widely held though debatable claim is that the picture of an object
  like a frying pan automatically elicits features of a left/right-handed grasp
  action even in perceptual tasks that make no demands on the observer to
  consider the graspable properties of the depicted object. Here, we sought to
  further elucidate this claim by relying on a methodology that allowed us to
  distinguish between the influence of motor versus spatial codes on the
  selection of a left/right-handed response while electroencephalographic data
  were recorded. In our experiment, participants classified images of frying
  pans as upright or inverted using a left/right key press or by making a
  left/right-handed reach-and-grasp action towards a centrally located response
  element while we recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) data. In line with
  previous evidence (Bub, Masson, & van Noordenne, Journal of Experiment
  Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 47(1), 53â€“80, 2021), these two
  modes of responding generated distinct correspondence effects on performance
  induced by the same set of images. In terms of our EEG data, we found that
  neither motor (the lateralized readiness potential) nor visual (N100 and P100)
  potentials were sensitive to handle-response hand correspondence. However, an
  exploratory theta analysis revealed that changes in frontal theta power
  mirrored the different correspondence effects evoked by the image on key press
  responses versus reach and grasp actions. Importantly, our results provide a
  link between these disparate effects and the engagement of cognitive control,
  highlighting a possible role of top-down control processes in separating motor
  features from the task-irrelevant features of an object, and thus in claims
  regarding object affordances more generally."
