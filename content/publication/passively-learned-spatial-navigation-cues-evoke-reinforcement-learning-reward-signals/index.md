abstract: Since the suggestion by Tolman (1948) that both rodents and humans
  create cognitive maps during navigation, the specifics of how navigators learn
  about their environment has been mired in debate. One facet of this debate is
  whether or not the creation of cognitive maps – also known as allocentric
  navigation – involves reinforcement learning. Here, we demonstrate a role for
  reinforcement learning during allocentric navigation using event-related brain
  potentials (ERPs). In the present experiment, participants navigated in a
  virtual environment that allowed the use of three different navigation
  strategies (allocentric, egocentric-response, & egocentric-cue), in which
  their goal was to locate and remember a hidden platform. Following the
  navigation phase of the experiment, participants were shown “cue images”
  representative of the three navigation strategies. Specifically, we examined
  whether or not these passively learned strategy images elicited a reward
  positivity – an ERP component associated with reinforcement learning and the
  anterior cingulate cortex. We found that when allocentric navigators were
  shown previously learned cues predicting the goal location a reward positivity
  was elicited. The present findings demonstrate that allocentric navigational
  cues carry long-term value after navigation and lend support to the claim that
  reinforcement learning plays a role in the acquisition of allocentric
  navigation and thus the generation of cognitive maps.
