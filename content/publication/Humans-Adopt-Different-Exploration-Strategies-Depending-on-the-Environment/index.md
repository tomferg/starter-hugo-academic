abstract: Humans explore to learn the structure of our environment. However, 
  it remains unclear how consistent humans are in the exploration strategies 
  we use and how often we explore across different environments which vary in 
  their volatility. Using a within-subjects design, participants (n = 30) 
  completed (1) a non-stationary bandit task where the reward values changed 
  throughout, and (2) a stationary bandit task where one option always gave better 
  reward. We used a series of reinforcement learning models to understand the 
  exploration strategies humans adopted in the two tasks. We found that most 
  participants adopted a behavioural heuristic strategy (Win-Stay, Lose-Shift) 
  in the non-stationary bandit task. In contrast, most participants adopted a 
  probabilistic, random exploration strategy (Softmax) in the stationary bandit task. 
  We compared our results when fitting models individually within each task to when
  fitting models across both tasks—that is focusing on long-term predictions. 
  When fitting across both tasks we found that most participants solely adopted 
  a probabilistic, random exploration strategy. In addition, we found a moderate, 
  positive relationship between exploration rate in each of the two bandit tasks. 
  Our findings show that humans can flexibly adopt different exploration strategies 
  depending on task demands, which we suggest is because the two bandit tasks assessed 
  different aspects of learning and required different levels of cognitive flexibility.
  In addition, we speculate that the relationship between exploration rate could reflect 
  a personality trait such as risk-taking. In sum, we found evidence for the flexible 
  use of exploration strategies, while also observing evidence of the generalization
  of exploration across tasks.
