abstract: Humans often rely on feedback to learn. Indeed, in learning the
  difference between feedback and an expected outcome is computed to inform
  future actions. Further, recent work has found that reward and feedback have a
  unique role in modulating conflict processing and cognitive control. However,
  it is still not clear how conflict, especially concerning the processing and
  evaluation of feedback, impacts learning. To address this, we examined the
  effects of feedback competition on feedback evaluation in a reinforcement
  learning task. Specifically, we had participants play a simple two-choice
  gambling game while electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded. On half
  of the experiment blocks, we reversed the meaning of performance feedback for
  each trial from its prepotent meaning to induce response conflict akin to the
  Stroop effect (e.g., ‘✓’ meant incorrect). Behaviourally, we found that
  participants’ accuracy was reduced as a result of incongruent feedback.
  Paralleling this, an analysis of our EEG revealed that incongruent feedback
  resulted in a reduction in amplitude of the reward positivity and the P300,
  components of the human event-related brain potential implicated in reward
  processing. Our results demonstrate the negative impact of conflict on
  feedback evaluation and the impact of this on subsequent performance.
