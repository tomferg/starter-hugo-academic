abstract: Stress has been defined in many ways and is typically induced as a
  response to a threat to homeostasis. Stress affects decision-making, and the
  effects of stress on subcomponents of decision-making can be indirectly
  measured through EEG. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects
  of acute stress on the neural correlates of decision-making. We hypothesized
  that acute stress would decrease the reward and attentional sensitivity, seen
  through reduced P300 and reward positivity component activity. The results
  were that the mean percent change from baseline for heart rate was higher for
  the stress condition during the TSST. The stress group also had decreased
  positive affect scores and increased negative affect scores for the STAI
  questionnaire and decreased positive affect scores for the PANAS
  questionnaire. Additionally, while not significant, there was a trend towards
  reduced P300 component activity in the stress condition, potentially
  indicative of reduced attentional sensitivity. Further research is needed to
  explore the implications for reward sensitivity, utilizing multiple tasks, and
  including cortisol measurement. Stress is common to everyday life and has been
  implicated chronically in numerous health conditions. Understanding how stress
  affects executive function, particularly decision-making, is therefore crucial
  in both the short- and long-term.
