abstract: Objective: In the present study, we examined the relationships between athlete burnout, brain function, and self-assessment of performance, and how these relationships can be quantified using mobile electroencephalography (mEEG). Specifically, we performed this study to determine whether mEEG can be utilized as an objective measure of athlete burnout. In addition, we sought to determine whether there was any relationship between athlete burnout and athlete self-assessment of performance while controlling for our neural results.

Methods: We tested these relationships in a sample of high-performance athletes – whereby we had athletes complete an mEEG assessment and also had the athletes complete a questionnaire assessing burnout prior to participating in practice. Following practice, athletes were asked to provide a self-assessment of their performance.

Results: We found that athlete burnout had a moderate, negative relationship with neural oscillations associated with concentration. We also found that athletes with higher self-reported focus had larger neural oscillations associated with focus. Further, we also found that higher athlete confidence was associated with lower frontal neural oscillations.

Conclusions: Taken together, our findings suggest that athlete burnout has a negative impact on brain function, which may, in turn, affect sports performance.
