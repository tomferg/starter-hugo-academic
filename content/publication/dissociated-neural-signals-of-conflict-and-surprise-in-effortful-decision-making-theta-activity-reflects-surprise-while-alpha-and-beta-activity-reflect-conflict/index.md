abstract: "What makes a decision difficult? Two key factors are conflict and
  surprise: conflict emerges with multiple competing responses and surprise
  occurs with unexpected events. Conflict and surprise, however, are often
  thought of as parsimonious accounts of decision making rather than an
  integrated narrative. We sought to determine whether conflict and/or surprise
  concurrently or independently elicit effortful decision making. Participants
  made a series of diagnostic decisions from physiological readings while
  electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded. To induce conflict and
  surprise, we manipulated task difficulty by varying the distance between a
  presented physiological reading and the category border that separated the two
  diagnoses. Whereas frontal theta oscillations reflected surprise – when
  presented readings were far from the expected mean, parietal alpha and beta
  oscillations indicated conflict – when readings were near the category border.
  Our findings provide neural evidence that both conflict and surprise engage
  cognitive control to employ effort in decision making."
